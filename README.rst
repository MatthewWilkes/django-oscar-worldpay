This package provides integration between django-oscar_ and Worldpay Select Junior (also known as HTML Redirect).

.. _django-oscar: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar

These payment options can be used individually or together.  Further, the
package is structured so that it can be used without Oscar if you so wish.

Current status
--------------

We believe this product is usable in production, but as always, it is released as-is without warranty. If you find any bugs please submit either a
bug report or a pull request.

Security
--------

This package supports the so-called 'MD5 Encryption' security of Worldpay, with configurable fields. It also implement the DNS based checking of
response callbacks.

It uses C_Parameters internally for passing cart information back, this uses a SHA-based HMAC for verification.

This package doesn't yet support the `callbackPW` parameter, patches to add this would be very welcome.

Configuration
-------------

The following parameters should be set:

    * WORLDPAY_INSTANCE_ID
        A string containing your instance ID, such as '12345'
        
    * WORLDPAY_TEST_MODE
        A boolean to determine test mode

    * WORLDPAY_MD5_SECRET
        The string entered in the MD5 field of WorldPay's console, or None
        
    * WORLDPAY_SIGNATURE_FIELDS
        A tuple of field names, such as ('instId', 'cartId', 'amount', 'currency'), to use with the MD5 Secret

    * WORLDPAY_REMOTE_ADDRESS_HEADER
        A string pointing to the key in Request.META that contains the IP of the request's origin.
        Usually either `REMOTE_ADDR` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`.

Gotchas
-------

Worldpay's recommended authentication of requests is based on multiple DNS lookups. Please be sure you have a working and reliable DNS setup
before using this package. Patches to make this lookup optional and to add the `CallbackPW` alternative would be welcome.

You also need the dynamic callback response parameter to be enabled. Currently there are two callbacks, a fail and a success callback. If these
two were integrated this requirement could be dropped.
